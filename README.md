# ETCnomad-Touchbar
Touchbar Preset for BetterTouchTool

Hello there!
The process is incredibly simple when looked at in its broad sense, but I'm available for any and all questions you may have while trying to get things up and running.

## BetterTouchTool Import

First, jump online and download [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/). Purchasing the full version of the app is always best when utilizing it's services to the extent this preset does, but the free version should do for our needs.

Open up BTT and, if it isn't there already, navigate to the Touch Bar settings option on the drop down in the top section of the app:

Once here, click on the "Preset: Master"  drop down and select "Import"

Navigate to the downloaded BTT preset file and follow the prompts.

NOTE: If it asks you to overwrite, please take caution if you have a custom Touch Bar preset for ETCnomad already, as this will remove it.
